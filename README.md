# Texts’ Editor Themes

This repo is a small collection of (quick and dirty) custom editor themes for [Texts.app](http://www.texts.io).

**Please note** some elements have not been styled so if you are using Math, verbatim or tables, styling is up to you.

## Install Text’s Editor Themes

1. Download this repo as zip
2. Unzip the downloaded file
3. drop .theme files into `~/Library/Application Support/Texts/` folder on Mac OS X or into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Texts\` folder on Windows

Those themes are now available in the "View > Theme" menu.

## Available themes

**Note:** Some of these themes are using fonts that aren’t necessarily available in your OS. A download link is provided when free fonts are used.

### Ailes

That one is using Avenir Next with Avenir and Helvetica as fallbacks. You may pick another font-stack for Windows.

### Bright Elements

That one is using Seravek (Gill Sans as fallback) and Charter (Palatino as fallback). It should work OK in Windows.

### Dark Elements

Same as Bright Elements.

### iA

Shameless copy of iA Writer’s default theme. It is using Lekton, which you can [download on FontSquirrel](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/lekton).

### Preview

That one is using [Alegreya Sans](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/alegreya-sans).

### Simple

Good old web-safe fonts to the rescue: Arial and Georgia are combined in there.
